            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a less messy way to deal with saving multiple version of a project. Instead of saving all version as hundreds of files, version control is a main repository for all the project files. The people working on the project can check out files, edit them, and check them back in without having to worry about file sharing. A version control system (VCS) takes notes on who changed the files, when, and what is new. This eliminates a lot of issues that might otherwise take place. There is a common repository in a VCS that holds all the latest files. When one is created, developers can record their change history and track their status and version. There are two kinds of repositories that can be used. Remote, which resides on a remote server that is shared, and local, which resides on a machine of an individual user. To create a local repository, you can create a new repository, or clone an existing, remote one. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open so distributed VCS designed to handle all types of projects with speed and efficiency. It has multiple features, including cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. Everything is local, so you do not have to have access to the server to work. There are also no single points of failure. It runs much faster, and will prevent unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Git is also check-summed before it is stored and is referred to by that checksum. This means that you cannot change any files or directory without Git knowing about it. You cannot lose information in transit, or corrupt a file, without Git knowing. This can help prevent errors, or makes previous errors easier to find. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Topic 3!
                <span class="text-muted">How Does Git Work?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three stages that your files on Git can reside in; committed, modified, and staged. If your files are committed, that means the data is safely stored on your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file, but have no yet committed it to your database. And staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. Git allows all of this to happen without having developers overwrite or change other developerâ€™s code. It also lets you save and commit multiple versions of your project, without it getting complex. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What are the Stages of a Git Project?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main sections of a Git project; the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The Git directory is what is copied when you clone a repository, and is where Git stores the metadata and object database of your project. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. They are pulled out of the compressed database and put on disk for you to modify. Lastly, the stating area is a file that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Overall, you modify your files in your working tree, stage them, adding snapshots to your staging area, and do a commit; which takes the files as they are in your staging area and stores that snapshot permanently in your Git directory. Overall, you add (put on your local repository), commit (save permanently), and push (put back onto the remote repository). </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What are some Git Commands?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a few different types of Git commands. First, the basic commands include git commit, git branch, git checkout, and git checkout -b. Git commit simply commits your current version to the repository. Git branch creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit. They can also be deleted. Git checkout can do many things, but its main use is to switch between branches. You can also checkout individual commits. Git checkout -b is a combination of git branch and git checkout. This will creat the branch if it does not already exist, as well as immediately check it out. There are two undo commits. Git reset will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever you specify, abandoning any commits left behind. This is useful to undo unneeded commits. There are also three flags; soft, mixed, and hard. Never use git reset to abandon commits that have already been pushed or merged into the origin. It may cause your local repository to become out-of-sync. Lastly, git revert is used to under commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team. It creates a new omit that will undo all of the work that was done in the commit you want to revert. </p>
